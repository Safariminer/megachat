<h1>My MegaChat server</h1>
<p>This is what people will see when they visit your MegaChat server URL from the browser. Make it pretty!</p>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Some ideas of what to put in here:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some info on your server</li>
  <li>Write some code to detect how many are online</li>
  <li>Put in the best messages of your log</li>
  <li>Award active users of your community for participating</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some questions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Q: Can I delete index.php?<br/>A: Yes. You can delete both the contents of the file and the file itself.</li>
  <li>Q: Why is there this page in the first place if it's not used by MegaChat?<br/>A: Because putting an index file in a web project is kind of a standard convention at this point.</li>
  <li>Q: Why isn't this a Lorem ipsum?<br/>A: I tend to put too much effort in stupid parts of my projects.</li>
  <li>Q: What page is actually used by MegaChat?<br/>A: mega.php</li>  
</ul>

<p>MegaChat is actively maintained by CatArtik. Please give them some hugs, they clearly need mental support, as they're refering to themselves using they instead of he and as they're refering to themselves in the third person.</p>
